# Mine data with Elasticsearch
<p align=center>

The purpose of this demo is to show how to feed data into Elasticsearch from API calls, Fluent, [Aircraft Delays](https://www.transtats.bts.gov), and a desired Twitter hashtag for data analytics and then archive them to S3. This demo will run Fluentd, Elastisearch, Kibana, and the Minio S3 Server in a microservices architecture.

### Prerequisites

1. Docker for [Mac](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg) or [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi).
2. This Git [Repo](https://github.com/rusher81572/elasticsearch-demo/archive/master.zip)
3. 3GB of RAM or greater for Docker
4. (Optional) [Twitter API credentials](https://dev.twitter.com/)

### Building the images
```
unzip elastic-demo-master.zip
cd elastic-demo-master
docker-compose build
```
If you want to use the Twitter app to mine data from Twitter, modify the twitter section of docker-compose.yml with
your developer API credentials.

### Starting the containers

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Please wait about 2 minutes for the S3 Server and MySQL to start properly.

### Check the status of the containers
```
docker ps
```

You should see the following containers running:

```

```

### Login to the Minio web console to see the logs
1. Goto http://127.0.0.:9000 in your web browser
2. Login with accessKey1 for the username and verySecretKey1 for the password
3. After a few minutes, the Elasticsearch log files will start appearing there from Fluent.


### Accessing Kibana
1. Goto https://0.0.0.0:5601 in your web browser
2. Click the create button
3. Start analyzing data

The default index of "logstash" will show you the Elasticsearch logs.

To view Twitter traffic, change the index to twitter or go to Management->Index Patterns-> + and then add twitter. Uncheck 'Index contains time-based events'.

To view Flight delay data, change the index to flightdata or go to Management->Index Patterns-> + and then add flightdata. Uncheck 'Index contains time-based events'.

### Stopping and Erasing the demo

The following commands will stop and delete all running containers.

```
docker-compose kill
docker-compose rm -f
```

To start the demo again, simply run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
